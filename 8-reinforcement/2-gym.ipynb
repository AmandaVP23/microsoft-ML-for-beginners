    "In Q-Learning, we need to build Q-Table that defines what to do at each state. To be able to do this, we need state to be discreet, more precisely, it should contain finite number of discrete values. Thus, we need somehow to discretize our observations, mapping them to a finite set of states.\n",

This can be done using the numpy [`digitize`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html) method. In this case, we will precisely know the state size, because it will depend on the number of bins we select for digitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ We can use linear interpolation to bring values to some finite interval (say, from -20 to 20), and then convert numbers to integers by rounding them. This gives us a bit less control on the size of the state, especially if we do not know the exact ranges of input values. For example, in our case 2 out of 4 values do not have upper/lower bounds on their values, which may result in the infinite number of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will go with the second approach. As you may notice later, despite undefined upper/lower bounds, those value rarely take values outside of certain finite intervals, thus those states with extreme values will be very rare.\n"

Would it make more sense to always select the best action, with the highest Q-Table value?

    "We have now learned how to train agents to achieve good results just by providing them a reward function that defines the desired state of the game, and by giving them an opportunity to intelligently explore the search space. We have successfully applied the Q-Learning algorithm in the cases of discrete and continuous environments, but with discrete actions.\n",

    "It's important to also study situations where action state is also continuous, and when observation space is much more complex, such as the image from the Atari game screen. In those problems we often need to use more powerful machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, in order to achieve good results. "
